# Letter of support for applicants' referral request in _Koureas and Others v. Greece_

## European Court of Human Rights
### Application No. 30030/15

We, the undersigned attorneys and legal scholars, write to strongly support the applicants’ referral request in _Koureas and Others v. Greece_, no. 30030/15, ECHR 2018. The chamber judgment in this case requires review because its interpretation of Article 41 of the ECHR diverges from existing Grand Chamber precedent in ways that undermine the ability of human rights victims to obtain remedies before this court. 

At issue in this case is the award of attorneys’ fees under Article 41. The chamber rejected the applicants’ request for such fees because the applicants could not produce an invoice from the attorney. While this might, at first glance, seem like an unremarkable decision, it ignores the predicament of many human rights abuse victims and their attorneys. The problem is that victims with limited financial means rely on attorneys who are willing to represent them without upfront payments and assume the risk of non-payment in the absence of a sufficient award of damages. Such victims will not be able to produce invoices when claiming fees under Article 41. Worse, in states that, like Greece, impose taxes and third-party contributions on lawyers based on fixed minimum legal services rates (irrespective of whether the lawyer is actually paid), these attorneys expose themselves to huge liability. When they win a judgment that does not include their fees, they may be forced to pay taxes and third-party contributions on income they will never actually receive. This is exactly what happened to the attorney in this case.

In fact, it appears this predicament is being used by Greece as a weapon against human rights defenders and a roadblock to future claims against it. Thus, while Greece suffered a minor loss in _Koureas_ for its detention practices, the chamber simultaneously handed it a huge victory by pushing the applicants’ attorney toward financial ruin and making it increasingly unlikely that other attorneys will step up to provide similar assistance to those in need. The result will be to drastically reduce legal representation before this court, undermining human rights protections.

The chamber’s judgment here runs counter to the framework established by _Iatridis v. Greece_ [GC], no. 31107/96, ECHR 2000, _Selmouni v. France_ [GC], no. 25803/94, ECHR 1999, and _Kuric and Others v. Slovenia_ [GC], no. 26828/06, ECHR 2014, as explained in the applicants’ brief. Moreover, this is one of many decisions that have taken this approach. This pattern is leading to a situation by which Article 41 is undermining the rest of the Convention. Applicants not only have a right to effective assistance of counsel, they also have a clear need for it. As attorneys and legal scholars, we have seen how important representation can be to the outcome of cases.

We urge the Grand Chamber to step in and correct this.
